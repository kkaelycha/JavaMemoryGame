# Java Memory Game
Kaely has created a simple memory game in the Java language. This is one of her first projects, not only in Java, but in programming as well. 

## How To Play
Enter a number, 1 through 4, from the column when prompted. Then enter another number, 1 through 4, from the row when prompted again.
The two numbers selected will "flip" the first card on the board, and you will repeat the same steps to flip the second card! If both the numbers that were flipped match one another, they will stay up until the end of the game. This will continue until the player enters "Q" or "q" when asked if they want to quit the game. 

## Features To Be Added
- A point system for how many matches were found before quitting the game
- A congratulatory message for finding all the matches, and asking if the player would like to play again
- Allow the player to quit the game whenever they want instead of waiting for the option to quit
